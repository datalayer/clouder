# Clouder

Create, manage and share Kubernetes clusters.

- Create and monitor Kubernetes clusters.
- Manage Helm deployments.
- Schedule the size of the Kubernetes clusters.
- Share the cluster and give controlled access to other users.
- Take backup and restore for disaster recovery.

## Building on Kubernetes

Clouder connects your Kubernetes cluster to external, non-Kubernetes resources, and allows platform teams to build custom Kubernetes APIs to consume those resources.

Clouder creates Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to represent the external resources as native Kubernetes objects. As native Kubernetes objects, you can use standard commands like kubectl create and kubectl describe. The full Kubernetes API is available for every Clouder resource.

Clouder also acts as a Kubernetes Controller to watch the state of the external resources and provide state enforcement. If something modifies or deletes a resource outside of Kubernetes, Clouder reverses the change or recreates the deleted resource.

With Clouder installed in a Kubernetes cluster, users only communicate with Kubernetes. Clouder manages the communication to external resources like AWS, Azure or Google Cloud.
Clouder also allows the creation of custom Kubernetes APIs. Platform teams can combine external resources and simplify or customize the APIs presented to the platform consumers.
