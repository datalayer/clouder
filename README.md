# ☁️ Clouder

> Create, manage and share Kubernetes clusters.

Clouder is a CLI and JupyterLab extension to interact with cloud services. Devops can manage Kubernetes clusters, SSH Keys, virtual machines, S3 buckets on multiple clouds in a seamless way. Clouder provides advanced collaboration and cost optimisation features:

- Create and monitor Kubernetes clusters.
- Manage Helm deployments.
- Schedule the size of the Kubernetes clusters.
- Share the cluster and give controlled access to other users.
- Take backup and restore for disaster recovery.

AWS and OVHcloud are supported for now. Support of other cloud is planned in subsequent Datalayer releases.

Read more on the [Clouder documentation](https://clouder.sh) website.
